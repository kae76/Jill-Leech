## Statement

**Although I am a textile artist I like the freedom to work in any material and on any scale. This is reflected in my wallhangings which can be a modest 15"x17" or a bold 7'x4.5', space is the only thing preventing me going bigger, at the moment.**

Textile to me is anything that can be hooked, woven or sewn. To this base I add carved and shaped wood, metal and glass.  With these materials I recreate geological features and maritime views. I often work from photographs and this has lead me to look at photography as a new way of expressing myself.

In 2000 I lead a group of artists in the building of an installation on the beach at Mundesley, Norfolk with the express purpose of using the project as a photo opportunity.  
Although it was very hard work over a short space of time it was very successful and I hope to lead many more projects of this type.  
The following year I exhibited the photographs in Braintree and recreated the installation in the town centre.

2005 Bought in a new way of looking at photography, using computer magic I've turned my photographs into multi-pattern images with the use of flip, mirror and rotate. This will often bring about very exciting and stimulating new work.
